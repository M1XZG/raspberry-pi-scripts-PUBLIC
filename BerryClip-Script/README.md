	       BerryClip - 6 LED Board

	--------------------------------------

The BerryClip is a simple, cheap and easy to use add-on board for the Raspberry Pi. It plugs
directly onto the Pi's GPIO header and provides 6 coloured LEDs, 1 Buzzer and 1 Switch. It
can be controlled using any programming language that can manipulate the GPIO pins.

Please go and check out the board and the original scripts here

I also have a blog posting of my experiences with this board and my own scripts
