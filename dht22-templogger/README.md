## Description
=====

This script was created from a number of sources, many I'm afraid I can no longer recall.  My python skills are pretty lame, but I was able to cobble together several scripts that did various things that I wanted into this one.  Previous versions did things like log to a CSV file locally, but that's cumbersome.  I then had it dumping to a Google Docs Sheet, that worked well however the limitations of Google Sheets was very quickly reached and things broke.  Finally, I found scripts to let me log to https://thingsspeak.com.  Since then there's no looking back.

## Instructions
======

There is very little editing required for this script, however there are some bits you MUST edit.
